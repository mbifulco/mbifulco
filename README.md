# About me

![Mike Bifulco](https://github.com/mbifulco/mbifulco/blob/main/banner.jpeg?raw=true)

I'm a developer advocate, writer, podcaster and serial startup founder. In the past I've worked for Google, Stripe, Microsoft, and Gymnasium. I'm cofounder of APIs You Won't Hate, the largest online community of API Developers. I'm happiest when I can help other people, and I love building exceptional experiences in unexpected places.

## My beliefs

- I believe in the power of critical thought, and the scientific process.
- I believe all people deserve fair and equitable access to all things. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
- I know that my knowledge is imperfect, and I can be blind to my privilege. I'm always willing to listen.
- There is opportunity for design and technology to impact and benefit all facets of our life.
- Humor is a universal language. I try not to take myself too seriously.
