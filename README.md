# About me

![Mike Bifulco](https://github.com/mbifulco/mbifulco/blob/main/banner.jpeg?raw=true)

Hi there, I'm Mike Bifulco. I live in Charlotte, North Carolina, where I work as the CTO and co-founder of [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com), a Y Combinator S23 company. I'm also a developer advocate, writer, podcaster and serial startup founder. In the past I've worked for Google, Stripe, Microsoft, and Gymnasium. I'm cofounder of [APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com), a community for API Developers on the web. Mike's publishes a weekly newsletter for product builders called Tiny Improvements at [mikebifulco.com/newsletter](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter).


I'm driven by a desire to use my skills and privilege to help other people, and I love building exceptional experiences in unexpected places.

## My beliefs

I believe in the power of critical thought and the scientific process, as well as the concept that all people deserve fair and equitable access to all things. I am aware of my limitations and privilege, and am always open to listening to other perspectives. I also think that technology and design have the potential to benefit all aspects of our lives, and I try to maintain a sense of humor throughout it all.
